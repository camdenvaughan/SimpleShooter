This is a project that I created following the GameDevTV Udemy Course using free art assets.

These are just the Source Files, the rest was too big for Github.

Upon finishing it, I decided to add a few more features to make it a more complete experience.

Things I added:

	-Menu/Pause System
	-Menu Cinematic
	-2 New Weapons (Sniper, Shotgun)
	-Weapon Swapping Mechanic
	-Ammo
	-Gun Cooldown Mechanic connected to UI
	-Scalable Pickups system with 2 pickups (Health and Ammo)
	-Pickups spawning on death of AI
	-General Cleanup and Refactoring of the code

It isn't perfect, but it was a fun project, and like always finishing something helped me improve my skill dramatically.
